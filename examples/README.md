Using SpatialPy
===========================

The files in this directory are Python [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) examples of [GillesPy3D](https://github.com/GillesPy3D/GillesPy3D) spatial deterministic/stochastic reaction-diffusion-advection simulations. 

* [Start Here](Start_Here.ipynb) &ndash; Start with a simple 2D model to learn the core features.
#### Reaction-Diffusion
* [3D Cylinder Demo](3D_Cylinder_Demo.ipynb)
#### Fluid Dynamics
* [Gravity](Gravity.ipynb)
* [Weir](Weir.ipynb)
